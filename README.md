# Pdf Merge Bot

This Chatbot for telegram can be used to merge PDFs.

It is based on the [unidoc](https://github.com/unidoc/unidoc) library.

To start the Bot you need to have a Telegram Bot Token. This can be done
discussing with [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather),
the father of all the bots.

When you have a token you can add it in the configuration file and start
the bot with `go run main.go`.

This bot will be hosted on [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and should be
accessible with the nick @PdfMergeBot.
